# Alexa Christou Photography

Alexa documents her overland travels with beautiful photographs. She needed somewhere to showcase the pictures she takes, for her friends, family and anyone else interested in travel and exploration.

The focus here is on simplicity, and giving the full stage to the stunning landscapes she captures. Creating a custom WordPress theme enabled me to have the control I wanted over the structure and styling while allowing Alexa to create galleries and manage image uploads independently.

#### Technologies

- PHP
- Wordpress
- jQuery
- SASS

## Status

Complete, but with plans to rebuild in Gatsby using either Wordpress or Contentful as a headless CMS.

## Reflection

I wanted to try coding with PHP since I focus on full-stack JavaScript development. Creating a custom Wordpress theme for Alexa’s photography was the perfect project. It was interesting to discover the semantic differences between PHP and JavaScript and how my skill in one can easily be transferred to another. By doing this project I gained the confidence in my ability to quickly pick up programming languages that I haven’t encountered before.

## Skills Gained

    * Wordpress
    * PHP
    * Awareness of concepts shared across different programming languages
